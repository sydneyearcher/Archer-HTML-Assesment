    <h1>HTML Assessment</h1>
    <p>&check;Markup the information on these two pages of instructions as an HTML document according to the criteria
        listed
        below: </p>
    <p>&check;Include everything in your HTML document. Yes, that means this line should be there too.
        And this one! And everything that appears before and after this line. All of the header
        stuff at the top too. Really. Maybe try using an &lt;h1&gt; &lt;&sol;h1&gt; element for the "HTML Assessment"
        text.</p>
    <p>&check;Oops - what you should find is that when you tried to write &lt;h1&gt; &lt;&sol;h1&gt; in the
        sentence above, the browser didn’t understand that you wanted to literally write
        those symbols instead of rendering an HTML element to the screen. A simple way to
        write the symbols for an HTML element without rendering the element is to replace
        the angled brackets &lt; &gt; with their entity character equivalents. The entity character for &lt; is &amp;lt;
        and the entity character for &gt; is &amp;gt; (the lt stands for less than and the gt stands for
        greater than, which is what those symbols usually mean when you write them!)</p>
    <p>Don’t worry about the presentation of content – just recreate the structure of this
        document with valid HTML.</p>
    <p>&check;This HTML document should be titled <em>Last Name – HTML Assessment</em>, replacing “Last Name” with your
        real
        last name. No need to fake it, I have a class roster. </p>
    <p>&check;Indent nested elements to visually represent the parent/child hierarchy between all of the elements in the
        HTML
        document.</p>
    <p>Link to a few web tools you can’t live without. These links will have to be absolute paths because they exist on
        the WWW, not on the server this page will exist on. </p>
    <p>1.<a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/">http://www.javascriptkit.com/</a></p>
    <p>2.<a href="http://www.webdesignernews.com/">http://www.webdesignernews.com/</a></p>
    <p>3.<a href="http://www.slack.com/">http://www.slack.com/</a></p>
    <p>&check;Include a <em>relative link</em> to a picture of yourself. If you don’t have a picture of yourself,
        include a
        picture of a cat. People on the Internet always get a kick out of that. </p>

    <p><strong>PATHS:</strong></p>
    <p>&check;The path to the root folder containing all of your labs and assignments in this class should be:</p>
    <p><strong>/home/students/nid/ public_html/dig3716c/labs </strong></p>
    <p>&check;This lab assignment should be in a sub- directory of your root folder called html, like this:</p>
    <p><strong>/home/students/nid/public_html/dig3716c/labs/html</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&check;Name your .html file, <em>assessment.html</em></strong></p>
    <p>&check;Any images in this lab assignment should be located in a sub-directory of your lab folder called "images",
        like
        this: </p>
    <p><strong>/home/students/nid/public_html/dig3716c/labs/html/images </strong></p>
    <p>&check;Here's a hint - use the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong/&gt; element to<strong> add importance to
            content.</strong></p>
    <p>&check;Your document should validate as HTML 5 at the <a
            href="http://validator.w3.org">http://validator.w3.org</a>
        page. Test it out here when you’re done marking up the page! </p>
    <p>&check;If you can put a checkmark next to each of these requirements, then you’re done!
        These requirements are similar to the way your assignment specifications will be
        written up, so make sure you understand them.</p>
